# Example files from a responsive jQuery Mobile web site (app?)

## About the code

FlipPics is a fictitious site built as an example for a jQuery Mobile workshop. 
It is intended for educational / discussion purposes.

The 5 folders represent a stepped process of applying progressive enhancement to build the application from basic HTML pages to a richer data-driven experience.

### Disclaimer

While some server code is used (in PHP), it SOLELY intended to illustrate the role that a server might play in this application, without causing too much distraction from the client-side implementation. There are much better ways to implement server-side code, but that's not the focus here!
